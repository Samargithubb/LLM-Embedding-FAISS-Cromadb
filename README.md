# Word Embedding to Vectors: A Guide to Semantic Search
## Welcome to this notebook, where we will explore two powerful techniques for transforming words into vectors, which are FAISS (Library) and Cromadb (Vector database.)

### LLM (Large Language Model)
#### A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. These models are characterized by their large size, massive neural network architectures, and extensive training on vast amounts of text data. They have become a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP).LLMs have had a transformative impact on the field of NLP and have found applications in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, customer support, content generation, and more. They continue to evolve and improve, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in natural language understanding and generation.

### Vectors
#### Vectors play a central role in LLMs by encoding information about language, context, and relationships between words and tokens. These vectors are learned during the model's training process, and their quality and expressiveness contribute to the model's ability to understand and generate natural language text.

### Word Embeddings
#### word embeddings are a fundamental technique for representing words or tokens as continuous vector representations in a multi-dimensional space. Word embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words and enable machines to understand and process language more effectively.

### FAISS
#### Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library developed by Facebook AI Research that is primarily used for effiecient similarity search and clustering of large datasets. FAISS has several ways for similarity search. L2(Euclidean distance), cosine similarity. Vector Libraries are often suffiecient for small, static data. Since it's not full fledged database. It doesnt have the CRUD(Create, Read, Update and delete) support.vector library are easy, lightweight, and fast to use. Examples of vector libraries are FAISS, ScaNN, ANNoy and HNSM

### Chromadb (Vector database)
### ChromaDB is an open-source vector database designed to store vector embeddings to develop and build large language model applications. The database makes it simpler to store knowledge, skills, and facts for LLM applications.
